# BurgerMenu

Handlebars Homework #14, due 11/2/19

## What is BurgerMenu?

BurgerMenu is a Node / Express app that uses mySQL as the database and handlebars to serve the HTML pages. Users will be able to create specialty burger recipes for our chefs to create at Good Vurger! AKA The best place to get a veggie burger in town. Users will then get to choose which burger they wish to devour.

## Getting Started / How to use

1. If you don't like the options of the burgers we have on our menu, create your own by typing in what you would like and clicking on submit. Your burger will appear on the menu like magic.

2. If you would like to eat one of the burgers on our menu, click the "devour" button for that burger and it will be added to your belly and no longer be available.
